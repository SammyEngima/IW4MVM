# IW4MVM (GSC)

### A work-in-progress moviemaking modification created for IW4M

This is a huge project I've been working on for more than a year now. 
The mod itself is quite complete but still needs some extra patchs that I'll work on over the time...
Please consider this as a beta-release of what you can call a "version 2" of the old mod
NB : This modification was designed to be working on the IW4x client. I can't recommend you enough to switch to that client if you didn't already.

**PLEASE NOTE THAT I WON'T PROVIDE ANY SUPPORT/HELP FILE ON THIS UNTIL ITS PUBLIC RELEASE.**
